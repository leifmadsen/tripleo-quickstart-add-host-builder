# tripleo-quickstart-add-host-builder

Can be included for use with TripleO Quickstart via a requirements file (loaded with `--requirements`). If added,
then at the end of the TripleO Quickstart run, will result in an `add_host.yml` file, that you can `include_tasks`
with in your Ansible wrapper roles.

Primarily used during a DCI run. May not be generic.
